Explanation - Video at bottom = https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/?ref=header_outind
Given an array with low, mid and high indexes(low/high/mid can be anywhere in between the list)
such that low <= mid < high and subarrays are sorted within itself
Subarray 1 = [low, mid]
Subarray 2 = [mid + 1, high]

"""
Time Complexity = Î¸ (m + n) where m = length(left_arr) and n = length(right_arr) We need to iterate through both m & n
Auxiliary Space: O(m + n), Additional space is required for the temporary array (result) used during merging
