| **Logic**                    | Similar to BFS. Start with an empty set and build all combinations, adding them to the empty set. | Keep dividing search space into 1/2. Use array bisection algorithm from Python Library to understand the concept. | Use Heap to store the largest element during iteration. Heap is very efficient in finding and removing numbers. | Uses recursion. Travels from left until it hits a dead-end and gathers the steps and traverses the right. | Directed Acyclic Graph. 1. One-way connection 2. No cyclic/loop | Uses queue. Goes to all branches rather in each level. | Need to traverse a sorted array.              |
| **Questions**                | To find the longest/shortest subset within a given list or string that satisfies a particular condition. | To find all the possible combinations (with/without repetitions). | Search in rotated sorted array.                       | Top ranking elements from a dataset.                    | Maximum depth of binary tree.                      | Course schedule                                     | Level order reversal of Binary tree.             | Return index of 2 numbers that add up to a target number in a sorted array. |
