This table contains the rating of a movie by a user in their review.
created_at is the user's review date.

Write a solution to:
Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of movies. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user name.
Find the movie name with the highest average rating in February 2020. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie name.
The result format is in the following example.

-- "Lexicographically" means dictionary order, similar to alphabetical order, but it also considers the entire string from left to right, one character at a time.
-- "Apple" comes before "Banana" â€” just like in a dictionary.
-- "Zebra" comes after "Elephant".
-- "Daniel" is lexicographically smaller than "Monica" because "D" comes before "M"
-- Hence order by column asc, no need to do length/char_length

--  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT SOLUTION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-- THIS MIGHT LOOK RIGHT BUT IT IS ******* WRONG *********
-- MySQL does not allow using ORDER BY inside subqueries when using UNION unless wrapped with derived tables or CTEs
