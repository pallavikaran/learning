product_key is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Write a solution to report the customer ids from the Customer table that bought all the products in the Product table.
Return the result table in any order.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input:
Customer table:
+-------------+-------------+
| customer_id | product_key |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |

Product table:
+-------------+
| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+
Output:

-- ================================================ SOLUTION 1 =========================================================

-- Count how many distinct products each customer bought.
-- Compare that COUNT to the TOTAL number of products in the Product table.

SELECT
    customer_id
FROM Customer c
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(distinct product_key) FROM Product)
