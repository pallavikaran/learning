Snowflake:
HIPPA compliance - Ability to access only NONPII/NOTPHI or PII/PHI data
Based on snowflake offerings, Business critical and VPS seems to be best as they provide:
Dedicated Metadata Store and Compute Resources - This isolation minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to PHI, supporting compliance with HIPAA's data protection standards.
Private Connectivity Options - (AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, and Google Cloud Private Service Connect) Private connectivity ensures that PHI is transmitted over secure channels, reducing exposure to potential breaches during data transfer, in line with HIPAA's transmission security requirements.
Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (Tri-Secret Secure) - This feature ensures that only authorized personnel can access and decrypt PHI, aligning with HIPAA's mandate for strict access controls and data confidentiality
Complete Isolation from Shared Infrastructure (VPS Only) - This complete isolation reduces the risk of data leakage or unauthorized access, supporting HIPAA's requirements for data segregation and security.
Access Controls - Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) within VPS ensures that only authorized users can access PHI, adhering to HIPAA's access control requirements.
Audit Logging and Monitoring - Utilizing VPS's capabilities to log and monitor data access and modifications helps in detecting and responding to unauthorized activities, fulfilling HIPAA's audit control obligations.
Data Encryption - Ensuring that PHI is encrypted both at rest and in transit within VPS aligns with HIPAA's data protection standards, safeguarding data from unauthorized access.
Key Strategies for Segregating PHI/PII Access in Snowflake
Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) - DM allows you to define masking policies that dynamically obfuscate sensitive data based on the user's role and context. For example, a policy can display full Social Security Numbers (SSNs) only to users with the Admin role, while masking the data for others.
Row Access Policies - Row access policies enable you to control which rows are visible to users based on specific conditions. For instance, a policy can restrict access to patient records to users associated with the same department.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - RBAC involves assigning users to roles that grant specific privileges. For example, the Admin role may have full access to employee(patient) data, while the Data Engineer/Analyst role has access limited to a specific data
Secure Views - Secure views encapsulate the logic for accessing data, ensuring that users cannot infer underlying data structures. For example, a secure view can combine data from multiple tables and apply masking policies to sensitive columns.
External Tokenization - External tokenization replaces sensitive data with tokens generated by an external service. For instance, a patient's name can be replaced with a token that can only be mapped back to the original name by the external service.
Key Design Principles
Table Level Access - Isolating PHI/PII data in a separate table controlled by RBAC. For example, a patient's demographics should have a separate tables which can be joined by prsn_prfl_id to other nonpii tables like preferences, insurance details, eligibility etc. Data Scientists can access the demographics table but Data Engineers can't.
Ensure Data Encryption - Leverage Snowflake's built-in encryption features to encrypt data at rest and in transit.
Adopt Data Anonymization Techniques - Use Snowflake's data anonymization capabilities to generate synthetic data for testing and validation purposes.
Establish Data Lineage and Auditing - Utilize Snowflake's data lineage and auditing features to monitor data activities and maintain compliance records.​
Domain Restriction - Ability to access data based on domains.

Data Residency - Data must be stored and/or processed within a specific country.
Utilize Snowflake's Multi-Region Architecture:

Snowflake supports deployment across various cloud regions, allowing you to choose where your data is stored and processed. Each Snowflake account is hosted in a single region, but you can maintain multiple accounts in different regions to align with local data residency requirements. This approach ensures that data remains within specified geographic boundaries

Implement Data Privacy Vaults:

To handle sensitive data securely and comply with regional regulations, consider using data privacy vaults. These vaults store sensitive data separately from your main Snowflake instance, ensuring that only de-identified or tokenized data resides within Snowflake. By deploying these vaults in specific regions, you can control where sensitive data is stored and processed, simplifying compliance with data residency

Leverage Snowflake's Data Sharing and Masking Features:

Snowflake's secure data sharing capabilities allow you to share data across different Snowflake accounts without moving the actual data, preserving its residency. Additionally, dynamic data masking enables you to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view specific data elements.

Stay Informed About Snowflake's Compliance Certifications:

Snowflake maintains various compliance certifications that can assist in meeting data residency and protection requirements. For example, Snowflake's offerings are authorized under FedRAMP, StateRAMP, and TX-RAMP, which provide standardized security requirements for cloud services used by government agencies

Consider Third-Party Solutions for Enhanced Data Residency Management:

For additional control over data residency, you might integrate Snowflake with third-party solutions like InCountry. These solutions allow you to redact and anonymize regulated data before it enters Snowflake, ensuring that sensitive information complies with local data residency laws while still enabling global analytics.

Design Your Data Architecture with Compliance in Mind:

When designing your data architecture, consider the following best practices:​

Data Localization: Store and process data within the regions required by applicable laws and regulations.​

Access Controls: Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.​

Data Minimization: Collect and retain only the data necessary for your operations to reduce compliance risks.​

Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of your data storage and processing activities to ensure ongoing compliance.
