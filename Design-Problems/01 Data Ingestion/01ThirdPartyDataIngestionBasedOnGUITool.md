## Q.  You need to ingest data from a third-party platform. The platform has an API, but you also have access to a GUI-based extraction tool with connectors for the platform.How would you approach this and what influences your decision?

## A. To decide whether to ingest data from the third-party platform via the API or the GUI-based extraction tool,
I would evaluate the tradeoffs based on several factors. Here's how I would approach the decision:
- 1. **Understand Requirements**
    - **Data Frequency**: Is the ingestion a one-time job, periodic, or real-time?
    - **Data Volume**: How large is the dataset? Is there any performance or rate-limiting concern?
    - **Data Complexity**: Are there transformations or joins required post-extraction?
    - **Automation Needs**: Does the process need to run unattended and reliably?
    - **Change Frequency**: How often do the data schema or platform APIs change?

- 2. **Evaluate API-Based Approach**
    - **Pros**:
        - Automation & Scalability: Easy to schedule, integrate with pipelines (e.g., Airflow), and run in CI/CD.
        - Granular Control: Fine-tuned queries, pagination, error handling, and retries.
        - Real-time or Incremental Ingestion: Ideal for up-to-date data via polling or webhooks.

   - ❌ **Cons**:
        - Development Overhead: Requires more initial coding and setup.
        - Rate Limits & Throttling: Can be a bottleneck for large data sets.
        - Authentication Complexity: May involve token refresh flows or OAuth2.

- 3. **Evaluate GUI-Based Tool**
   - **✅ Pros**:
     - Speed to Set Up: Often faster to get started with for testing or ad hoc pulls.
     - User-Friendly: Useful for business analysts or data users who aren't engineers.
     - Built-in Connectors: Handles auth, pagination, retries, and schema parsing.

   - ❌ **Cons**:
     - Limited Automation: May not be ideal for unattended or frequent loads.
     - Scalability Issues: May struggle with very large data or complex transformations.
     - Vendor Lock-in: Might not expose the full flexibility of the API or may incur licensing costs.

- 4. **Decision Influencers**
    - Factor Lean Towards API If..., Lean Towards GUI If...
    - Automation Needed Yes, No or low-frequency
    - Large or Complex Data	- Yes (e.g., need to manage data partitioning)	- No (small, manageable chunks)
    - Time Constraints	- No (you can invest time in setup)	Yes (you need results quickly or for POC/testing)
    - Skill Availability - You have engineering resources	You have more analysts or no access to dev resources
    - Long-Term - Use	Better for maintainability	More suited for temporary or one-off tasks
    - Data Freshness - Real-time or frequent syncs required	Ad hoc or periodic snapshot is sufficient

- **Final Approach**
    - If long-term, automated, and scalable ingestion is the goal: Use the API. Build a connector or pipeline using an ETL/ELT tool, or custom script with orchestration.
    - If this is for an ad hoc analysis, MVP, or short-term integration: Start with the GUI tool.
    - If it works well and fits the needs, you may not need to invest further
    - **Hybrid Option**: Use the GUI tool for initial data exploration or prototyping. Once the requirements stabilize, switch to API-based ingestion for robustness and automation.

## Q.  How would you debug a performance issue?

## A.  Debugging a performance issue involves a structured, data-driven approach to identify the root cause and determine the most effective fix. Here’s how I would tackle it:
- ✅ 1. Clearly Define the Problem
    - What is slow? (API call, DB query, page load, batch job, etc.)
    - How slow is it? (quantify latency, duration, throughput)
    - When does it occur? (always, intermittently, during peak hours?)
    - What changed recently? (deploys, config, data volume, infra)
    🔍 Goal: Narrow scope from "performance is bad" to a specific measurable issue.
- ✅ 2. Reproduce and Profile the Problem
    - Reproduce in a controlled environment (dev/staging if possible).
    - Use profiling tools appropriate to the system:
    - Backend/API: Flamegraphs, profilers (e.g., perf, py-spy, Go pprof)
    - Frontend: Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse
    - Database: EXPLAIN plans, slow query logs
    - System: top, htop, iotop, container stats
    🎯 Goal: Identify what is consuming time or resources.
- ✅ 3. Measure Resource Utilization
    - CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network usage: Are you hitting limits?
    - Database load: Connection pool saturation? Locking? Index misses?
    - App metrics: Use tools like Prometheus, Datadog, or New Relic.
    🧠 Look for bottlenecks — a system is only as fast as its slowest component.
- ✅ 4. Break Down the Execution Path
    - Trace the system’s end-to-end request flow:
    - Time taken on client (frontend)
    - Network latency
    - Backend API response time
    - Downstream services (DB, cache, 3rd-party APIs)
    🧩 This helps isolate whether the slowness is frontend-bound, backend-bound, or external.
- ✅ 5. Investigate and Test Hypotheses
    - Based on observations:
    - Slow DB query? → Add/modify indexes, rewrite queries.
    - Memory pressure? → Investigate leaks, tune GC, increase resources.
    - Too many I/O operations? → Use caching, batch writes, lazy loading.
    - External API bottleneck? → Add retries, fallbacks, caching, or timeouts.
    🧪 Make a change, measure again, and confirm performance improves.
- ✅ 6. Monitor Post-Fix
    - Confirm performance has improved under realistic conditions.
    - Add alerts for regressions (latency thresholds, error rates, resource usage).
    - Document findings and fixes for future reference. Example Debugging Scenario (API Latency)
    - Define: API /search is slow (>5s), started after last release.
    - Reproduce: Happens consistently in staging.
    - Profile: Shows DB query taking 4.7s.
    - Analyze DB: EXPLAIN shows full table scan due to missing index.
    - Fix: Add index → latency drops to 300ms.
    - Monitor: Set up latency SLO dashboards.

## Q.  How would you ensure values in a field could never be null?

## A.  To ensure values in a field can never be null, the approach depends on the layer of the system you're working in — database, application, or API level. The most robust solution typically enforces it at multiple layers for defense-in-depth. Here's how:

- ✅ 1. Database Layer (Primary Enforcement)
    - Enforce a NOT NULL constraint. This is the most authoritative and reliable way.
    - SQL Example (PostgreSQL / MySQL / etc.):
  ```
        ALTER TABLE users
        MODIFY COLUMN email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL;
    ```
    - Or during creation:
    ```
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );
     ```

- Why this matters:
    - Guarantees no row can be inserted or updated with a NULL value.
    - Independent of application logic or bugs.
    🔒 Always enforce data integrity at the source of truth — the database.

- ✅ 2. Application Layer (Validation)
    - Add validation in your backend or business logic.
    - Examples:
        - `Python (Django): email = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=False)`
        - `Java (Spring Boot): @NotNull annotation`
        - Node.js (Express/Sequelize):
        - ```
            email: {
              type: Sequelize.STRING,
              allowNull: false
            }
        ```
    - Purpose:
      - Catches nulls earlier, provides better error messages to users.
      - Ensures business logic is respected even before hitting the DB.

- ✅ 3. API/Input Layer (Validation & Schema)
    - Validate incoming data at the edge (e.g., REST or GraphQL APIs).
    - Examples:
        - OpenAPI/Swagger: Define fields as required
        - JSON Schema:
           - `   
            {
              "type": "object",
              "required": ["email"],
              "properties": {
                  "email": { "type": "string" }
                  }
                }
              `
        - Frontend Form: Use required in HTML input fields

- ✅ 4. **Data Migration (If Field Already Has Nulls)**
    - If the field already contains NULLs: Migrate existing nulls to a default or valid value.
        - `UPDATE users SET email = 'placeholder@example.com' WHERE email IS NULL;`
    - Then apply the NOT NULL constraint.

- ✅ Summary: Defense-in-Depth Approach
## Data Validation by Layer
| **Layer**     | **Enforcement**               | **Why**                                |
|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Database      | NOT NULL constraint           | Guaranteed enforcement                 |
| Application   | Field-level validation         | Business rule consistency              |
| API/Input     | Request validation/schema     | Early feedback to clients              |
| Migration     | Clean existing data           | Enables safe constraint addition
