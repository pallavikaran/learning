## What is a Data Pipeline? 
- A data pipeline is a series of processes designed to automate the movement and transformation of data from one system to another. 
- It encompasses the extraction of data from sources, its transformation to meet business needs, and its loading into a destination where it can be analyzed and utilized for decision-making purposes.

## Key Components of a Data Pipeline
- 1. **Data Sources**
  - Data sources are the origins from which data is collected. These can include: 
    -  Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) 
    -  NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) 
    -  APIs from third-party services (e.g., Twitter API) 
    -  IoT devices that generate real-time data 
    -  Files such as CSV or JSON documents 
    -  Each source contributes different types of data, which can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, depending on the context. 

- 2. **Data Transformation** 
  -  Once data is extracted from its source, it undergoes a transformation process. This involves: 
    - Cleaning: Removing inaccuracies and inconsistencies. 
    - Enrichment: Adding relevant information to enhance the dataset. 
    - Aggregation: Summarizing data for easier analysis. 
    - Filtering: Selecting only the necessary data for processing. 
    - Transformation ensures that the data is in a usable format that meets analytical requirements. 

- 3. **Data Destinations** 
  - The final component of a data pipeline is the destination where transformed data is stored for analysis. Common destinations include: 
    - Data warehouses (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery) optimized for query performance. 
    - Data lakes (e.g., AWS S3) that store raw data in its native format. 
    - Business intelligence tools that visualize and analyze data. 
    - The choice of destination depends on the specific needs of the organization and how they intend to use the data.
